 Modernization of Legacy Web Applications into Rich Internet Applications~\cite{Rodriguez-Echeverria:2011:MLW:2186508.2186536} proposes a approach for systematic and semiautomatic modernization of legacy Web applications in rich interfaces applications. In this process, the MDD principles are applied and the use of OMG Architecture Driven Modernization (ADM) specifications for the generation of rich interfaces from the source code of navigation and presentation layers of legacy web applications. %The proposed approach differs from this work by having a more general purpose and are not intended to only a single type of applications, such as Web applications.


Model-Driven Reengineering of Database~\cite{Wang:2009:MRD:1685997.1686596} presents a process to perform relational databases reengineering. The process is conducted through of repeated model transformations and divided into the stages of extraction and contextualization. In the extraction stage, a Platform Specific Model (PSM) is obtained from the database structure. In the contextualization stage, a Platform Independent Model (PIM) is generated from the PSM. As a result of the process, there are entity-relationship models and class diagrams.
