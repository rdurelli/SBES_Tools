 It is worth highlighting that CrossFIRE is open source and it can be downloaded at\textit{~www.dc.ufscar.br/$\sim$valter/crossfire}.


%      AE phase the engineer picks out which CFF can be reused in his base application by using the ProLine-RM.

%By using this plug-in engineers can share CFFs. Furthermore, it allows the engineers pick out these CFFs and reuse them in a base application. This reuse is  these CFFs through a feature model that correspond the features that the application really requires through a feature model. After that, the plug-in provides a way to download only the necessaries pieces of code that the application requires, avoiding death code.


%The ProLine-RM has two mainly functionality. The first one is provides a way to share all artifacts of the CFF. and reuse of a full cycle of reuse of the CFF.

%The use of the ProLine-RM is twofold, DE and AE phases. In the DE phase it provides an environment in which all of the CFF artifacts is developed. Afterwards, by using the ProLine-RM these artifacts will be stored in a remote repository in order to be reused in the AE phase. 


%The ProLine-RM allows the engineer shares, manages of the CFF. and provides full cycle of reuse of the CFF. Furthermore, it is possible  it allows the engineer shares, manages  


%provides full cycle of reuse of the CFF. Moreover, it is impor- tant a tool that supplies a graphical way to allow the engineer examines previously if the features available in one CFF fulfill the application requirements.
